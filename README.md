# duckchat
A practice project inspired by ICS(Introduction to computer system) in PKU.
ICS课程学习结束后突发奇想的实践项目

This is a simple chat software running on the shell in Linux.All the clients can send messages to other clients through the server.   
I code this naive program with my friend in the winter vacation in 2022, it's so simple that the clients will lose all the messages they have gotten the time they logout... And the server is able to see every messages, which is very unfriendly to privacy. Maybe I will update this software some day!
